## Overview

Welcome to the Unique DNA Barcodes Generator! This Python tool allows you to generate a diverse set of unique DNA barcodes for sample identification and genetic tracking in biological experiments.

## Features

- Generates 10,000 unique DNA barcodes with minimal similarity.
- Utilizes a 10-base DNA sequence and introduces three random mutations for uniqueness.
- Provides a Pandas DataFrame for easy barcode management and analysis.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python generate_barcodes.py` to create unique DNA barcodes.
4. Find the generated barcodes in the 'barcodes.csv' file.
